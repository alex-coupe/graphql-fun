# graphql-fun

Experimenting with GraphQL with a simple film list app. This is intended as a learning exercise for GraphQL and not a production quality application or perfect React code although this is the first time with using React hooks.

If you want to use this app. Clone the repo, add a .env file with a connection string to a mongodb instance.

    ConnectionString=<Your string here>
    
Then run `npm install`

Code is fully without warranty.
